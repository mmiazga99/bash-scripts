# bash-scripts

Hi,
these are my bash shell scripts, made mostly for practice purposes. Nonetheless, I did my best to make them as useful as I could.

The ideas for some of them are from:
  - O'Reilly online course: "Bash Scripting" by Sander van Vugt. Released August 2016.
  - Book: "Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible" (4th edition) by R. Blum, C. Bresnahan; Wiley. Released in January 2021.
  - Linux Training Academy online course: Shell Scripting: "Discover How to Automate Command Line Tasks" by Jason Cannon. Released in February 2017.
